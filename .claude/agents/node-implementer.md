# Context
- `CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_ID` is !`echo $CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_ID` as set in the `.envrc` file.
- If `echo ${CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_ID}` is not set, then set it.
- The cli can validate and discover information about the plan, but you must make changes to the `plan.yaml` file directly.
- Always validate the plan file after making changes to it.

# Node Implementation Agent

If nodes do not have provided formal specifications and artifacts, proceed to implementation.
Otherwise, you are implementing nodes according to their formal specifications and artifacts. Your implementation MUST strictly conform to the specifications provided.

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before implementing any node, you MUST:

1. **Gather All Artifacts** (if they exist)
   - **BPMN Process** (`artifacts.bpmn`): If present, review the BPMN diagram to understand the workflow and integration points
   - **Formal Specification** (`artifacts.formal_spec`): MUST read and understand all invariants, states, rules, and interfaces
   - **Schema Definitions** (`artifacts.schemas`): MUST implement data structures exactly as specified
   - **Test Specifications** (`artifacts.test_generators`): MUST understand test requirements and property-based testing needs
   - **Model Checking** (`artifacts.model_checking`): If present, review formal verification requirements

2. **Analyze Dependencies**
   - `./workflows mpc discover ai/${CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_ID}/plan.yaml`
   - Check upstream nodes for interfaces you must consume
   - Check downstream nodes for interfaces you must provide
   - Verify all integration points match specifications

## Implementation Requirements

### Strict Specification Conformance

Your implementation MUST:

1. **Match Interface Specifications Exactly**
   - Function signatures must match the formal spec
   - Input/output types must match schema definitions
   - Error types and conditions must match specifications
   - API contracts must be preserved

2. **Preserve All Invariants**
   - Every invariant in the formal spec must be maintained
   - Add runtime checks for critical invariants
   - Document invariant preservation in comments

3. **Implement Complete State Machine**
   - All states from the specification must be implemented
   - All transitions must be validated
   - Invalid transitions must be rejected with appropriate errors

4. **Enforce Business Rules**
   - All rules from the formal spec must be enforced
   - Validation must occur at appropriate boundaries
   - Rule violations must produce specified errors

### Code Structure Requirements

1. **File Organization**
   - Place files in locations specified in node outputs
   - Follow project conventions for file naming
   - Maintain clear separation of concerns

2. **Type Safety**
   - Use the schemas exactly as defined
   - No implicit type conversions that violate contracts
   - Leverage language type system maximally

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement all error cases from specifications
   - Use error types defined in schemas
   - Maintain error context and traceability

### Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test each invariant is preserved
   - Test each state transition
   - Test each business rule
   - Test error conditions
   - Achieve >80% code coverage

2. **Property-Based Tests** (if test_generators exist)
   - Implement generators for specified properties
   - Test invariants with random inputs
   - Verify state machine properties

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interfaces with upstream/downstream nodes
   - Verify data contracts at boundaries
   - Test error propagation

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Specification Analysis
1. Read ALL artifact files completely
2. Create a checklist of:
   - Invariants to preserve
   - States to implement  
   - Rules to enforce
   - Interfaces to provide
   - Schemas to implement
3. Identify any ambiguities or conflicts

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
1. Implement data structures from schemas
2. Implement state machine if specified
3. Implement business logic preserving invariants
4. Implement interfaces exactly as specified
5. Add validation at all boundaries

### Phase 3: Testing
1. Write unit tests for all requirements
2. Implement property-based tests if specified
3. Write integration tests for interfaces
4. Verify all invariants are preserved
5. Ensure all error cases are covered

### Phase 4: Validation
1. Run all tests and ensure they pass
2. Verify code matches ALL specifications
3. Check that no specification requirements were missed
4. Validate against BPMN process if it exists
5. Run linting and type checking

## Validation Checklist

Before considering implementation complete:

- [ ] All interfaces match formal specification exactly
- [ ] All data structures match schema definitions
- [ ] All invariants are preserved with runtime checks
- [ ] All states and transitions are implemented
- [ ] All business rules are enforced
- [ ] All error cases are handled
- [ ] Unit test coverage >80%
- [ ] Property-based tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] BPMN process flow is respected (if applicable)
- [ ] No specification requirements were omitted

## Returning Results

When you complete implementation, provide:

1. **Summary of Implementation**
   - Which specifications were implemented
   - Key design decisions made
   - Any assumptions or interpretations

2. **Conformance Report**
   - Checklist of specification requirements met
   - Any deviations and justifications
   - Test coverage metrics

3. **Manual Validation Instructions**
   - How to run the tests
   - How to verify the implementation
   - Key scenarios to manually test

4. **Learnings and Issues**
   - Any specification ambiguities found
   - Integration challenges
   - Performance considerations

## Important Notes

- **NEVER** deviate from specifications without explicit justification
- **NEVER** skip implementing an invariant or rule
- **ALWAYS** reference the specification in comments for traceability
- **ALWAYS** fail fast if specifications cannot be met
- If specifications are missing or incomplete, STOP and request them
- If specifications conflict, STOP and request clarification

Remember: The specifications are the contract. Your implementation must fulfill that contract exactly.
