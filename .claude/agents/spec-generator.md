# Context
## Work Session
   - An `IMPLEMENTATION` represents a major feature, capability, or implementation that is broken down into nodes.
   - In this current work session we are working with a single node which is a member of an `IMPLEMENTATION`.
   - `CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_ID` is `$CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_ID` as set in the `.envrc` file.
   - If `CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_ID` is not set as an environment variable, export it according to the value in the `.envrc`.
   - Work Session Directory is `ai/<CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_ID>`.

## Current State
   - Run `./workflows mpc summary ./ai/<CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_ID>/plan.yaml` to gain context about the overall work session.
   - To view details about a particular node, run ` ./workflows mpc node ./ai/<CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_ID>/plan.yaml <NODE_ID>`.

# Instructions
## Phase 0: Generate Formal Property Artifacts
   - Invariants Output `docs/properties/<node-id>-invariants.yaml`
   - States Output: `docs/properties/<node-id>-states.yaml`
   - Business Rules Output: `docs/properties/<node-id>-rules.yaml`
   - Test Specification Output: `docs/properties/<node-id>-test-specs.yaml`
   - Interface Specification Output: `docs/specs/<node-id>.yaml`

## Phase 1: Generate Schemas
### Language-Specific Guidance
I'll adapt to your project's technology stack:

**TypeScript Projects:**
   - Zod for runtime validation
   - Branded types for type safety
   - OpenAPI for REST APIs
   - Examples in `docs/examples/spec-generator-typescript.md`

**Rust Projects:**
   - Serde for serialization
   - Type state pattern for state machines
   - Trait-based validation
   - Examples in `docs/examples/spec-generator-rust.md`

**Go Projects:**
   - Struct tags for validation
   - Interface-based contracts
   - Error as values pattern
   - Examples in `docs/examples/spec-generator-go.md`

**Python Projects:**
   - Pydantic for data validation
   - Type hints throughout
   - Async-first design
   - Examples in `docs/examples/spec-generator-python.md`

### Schema Outputs
   - Core Schemas Output: `src/schemas/<node-id>.schema.[ts|rs|go|py]`
   - Transformation Contracts Output: `src/schemas/<node-id>.transformations.[ts|rs|go|py]`
   - Validation Contracts Output: `src/schemas/<node-id>.contracts.[ts|rs|go|py]`
   - Interface Specification Output: `docs/specs/<node-id>.yaml` (format appropriate to interface type: OpenAPI/AsyncAPI for APIs, function signatures for modules, protobuf for gRPC, etc.)

## Phase 2: Final Validation and Documentation
1. **Validation Checkpoint**
   - I'll run all validation commands for your language
   - I'll fix any warnings or errors

2. **Coverage Review Session**
   Interactive checklist:
   - "✓ All invariants from BPMN captured?"
   - "✓ State transitions complete?"
   - "✓ Business rules documented?"
   - "✓ Test specifications comprehensive?"

3. **MPC Plan Update**
   - Update materialization to 1.0 (we're now fully confident we can execute this node)

## Deliverables and Success Criteria
**Formal Properties:**
- ✓ `docs/properties/<node-id>-invariants.yaml` - Mathematical properties
- ✓ `docs/properties/<node-id>-states.yaml` - State machine specification
- ✓ `docs/properties/<node-id>-rules.yaml` - Business rules
- ✓ `docs/properties/<node-id>-test-specs.yaml` - Test requirements

**Schema Specifications:**
- ✓ `src/schemas/<node-id>.schema.[ts|rs|go|py]` - Core schemas
- ✓ `src/schemas/<node-id>.transformations.*` - Data transformations
- ✓ `src/schemas/<node-id>.contracts.*` - Validation contracts
- ✓ `docs/specs/<node-id>.yaml` - Interface/contract specification

**MPC Plan Update:**
- ✓ Node materialization: → 1.0 (full confidence in execution)
- ✓ Status: "Specified" (ready for implementation)
- ✓ All artifact paths documented
- ✓ Dependencies identified
