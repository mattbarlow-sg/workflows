# Context
- Work Session: `echo $CURRENT_WORK_SESSION`
- MPC Plan location: `ai/$CURRENT_WORK_SESSION/plan.yaml`
- BPMN artifacts: `docs/bpmn/*.json`
- Properties output: `docs/properties/`
- Schema output: `src/schemas/`
- Spec output: `docs/specs/`

# Instructions

I will help you extract formal properties and generate schema specifications from BPMN designs
through an interactive workshop process. Together we'll take a node that has completed Stage 1
(BPMN design) and guide it through:

- **Stage 2**: Formal Properties Extraction - Mathematical properties and invariants
- **Stage 3**: Schema-Driven Specifications - Validation contracts and transformations

This interactive process will create a complete specification that's ready for implementation.

## Phase 1: Understanding Your Node

1. **Review Node Context**
   - Let me first examine your MPC plan to understand which node we're working with
   - I'll review the BPMN design that was completed in Stage 1
   - Together we'll identify what needs to be formally specified
   
2. **Interactive Discovery**
   - I'll ask you about:
     - What invariants must always hold in this process?
     - What are the critical data validations?
     - Are there any business rules we need to enforce?
     - What state transitions are allowed or forbidden?
   
3. **Context Gathering**
   - I'll search the codebase for related patterns and interfaces
   - We'll review any existing specifications for consistency
   - I'll help identify dependencies from other nodes

## Phase 2: Formal Properties Workshop (Stage 2)

1. **Invariant Discovery Session**
   Together we'll identify properties that must always hold:
   - I'll analyze your BPMN to suggest potential invariants
   - You'll help me understand which are critical for your domain
   - We'll formalize these as mathematical properties
   - I'll create `docs/properties/<node-id>-invariants.yaml`
   
   Example questions I'll ask:
   - "I see a payment flow - should payment always precede shipping?"
   - "Are there any values that must stay within certain bounds?"
   - "What relationships between data fields must be preserved?"

2. **State Machine Exploration**
   We'll map out the allowed states and transitions:
   - I'll extract states from your BPMN gateways
   - You'll validate the transition rules
   - We'll identify forbidden transitions
   - I'll document liveness and safety properties
   - Output: `docs/properties/<node-id>-states.yaml`
   
   Interactive prompts:
   - "Can an order go directly from 'draft' to 'shipped'?"
   - "What happens if payment fails - what states are possible?"
   - "Should cancelled orders be permanent?"

3. **Business Rules Workshop**
   We'll capture all business constraints:
   - I'll identify decision points from BPMN
   - You'll explain the business logic
   - We'll formalize validation rules
   - I'll document temporal and contextual constraints
   - Output: `docs/properties/<node-id>-rules.yaml`
   
   Discovery questions:
   - "Are there minimum/maximum values for any fields?"
   - "Any time-based restrictions (business hours, deadlines)?"
   - "Rate limiting or throttling requirements?"

4. **Test Specification Planning**
   Together we'll define what tests should verify:
   - Property-based test scenarios
   - Deterministic test cases
   - Edge cases and error conditions
   - Output: `docs/properties/<node-id>-test-specs.yaml`

## Phase 3: Schema Design Workshop (Stage 3)

1. **Language and Framework Selection**
   Let's determine the right schema approach for your project:
   - I'll check your project's language and frameworks
   - You'll confirm the validation library preference
   - We'll select the appropriate schema patterns
   
   Questions I'll ask:
   - "I see you're using TypeScript - shall we use Zod for schemas?"
   - "Do you prefer runtime validation or compile-time only?"
   - "Any existing schema patterns I should follow?"

2. **Interactive Schema Creation**
   We'll build schemas together based on your BPMN:
   - I'll propose initial schema structures
   - You'll help refine field types and constraints
   - We'll encode invariants as schema refinements
   - I'll implement branded types for safety
   
   Collaborative process:
   - "For the user ID, should this be a UUID or custom format?"
   - "What's the maximum length for this description field?"
   - "Should we allow null values or make everything required?"

3. **Transformation Contract Design**
   Together we'll map data flows:
   - I'll identify transformations from BPMN
   - You'll validate the input/output contracts
   - We'll define error schemas
   - I'll create type-safe pipelines
   
   Workshop questions:
   - "When login succeeds, what exact fields should the response contain?"
   - "How should we handle partial failures in this flow?"
   - "What validation should happen at each transformation?"

4. **API Specification Review**
   We'll document the complete interface:
   - I'll generate OpenAPI/AsyncAPI specs
   - You'll review endpoints and schemas
   - We'll add examples and descriptions
   - Output: `docs/specs/<node-id>.yaml`

## Phase 4: Validation and Integration Workshop

1. **Contract Validation Session**
   We'll ensure all contracts are complete:
   - I'll create validation pipelines for your language
   - You'll review the validation logic
   - We'll test with example data
   - I'll refine based on your feedback
   
   Interactive validation:
   - "Here's a sample invalid input - is this the right error message?"
   - "Should validation fail fast or collect all errors?"
   - "Any custom validation rules beyond type checking?"

2. **Transformation Pipeline Review**
   Together we'll verify data flows:
   - I'll show you each transformation step
   - You'll confirm the business logic
   - We'll handle edge cases
   - I'll ensure invariants are preserved
   
   Collaborative refinement:
   - "This transformation assumes X - is that correct?"
   - "How should we handle missing optional fields?"
   - "What's the fallback for transformation failures?"

3. **Schema Composition Workshop**
   We'll build complex schemas from simple ones:
   - I'll propose composition patterns
   - You'll guide the relationships
   - We'll ensure consistency
   - I'll document the schema hierarchy

## Phase 5: Final Validation and Documentation

1. **Validation Checkpoint**
   Together we'll validate everything:
   - I'll run all validation commands for your language
   - We'll review any warnings or errors
   - You'll confirm the specifications match intent
   - I'll make final adjustments
   
   I'll guide you through:
   - "All TypeScript schemas compile successfully!"
   - "Found one validation gap - should we add this constraint?"
   - "Everything passes - ready to proceed?"

2. **Coverage Review Session**
   Let's ensure nothing is missed:
   - I'll show you the coverage checklist
   - You'll confirm each item
   - We'll add any missing pieces
   - I'll generate final documentation
   
   Interactive checklist:
   - "✓ All invariants from BPMN captured?"
   - "✓ State transitions complete?"
   - "✓ Business rules documented?"
   - "✓ Test specifications comprehensive?"

3. **MPC Plan Update**
   I'll update your plan with our work:
   - Update materialization to 1.0 (we're now fully confident we can execute this node)
   - List all created artifacts
   - Confirm the node is specification-complete
   - Prepare handoff for implementation

4. **Documentation Generation**
   Final documentation steps:
   - Generate API docs from schemas
   - Create developer guide
   - Export specifications
   - Package for implementation team

# Interactive Flow Example

```
User: "I need to create specifications for the auth-endpoints node"

AI: I'll help you extract formal properties and generate schema specifications for the 
auth-endpoints node through our interactive workshop. Let me start by understanding your context.

First, let me examine your MPC plan and BPMN design.

[Examines plan]:
./workflows mpc discover ai/$CURRENT_WORK_SESSION/plan.yaml

I found the 'auth-endpoints' node:
- Current Status: Ready
- Current Materialization: 0.8
- BPMN artifact: docs/bpmn/auth-flow.json

[Reviews BPMN]:
I can see your auth flow includes:
- Login with email/password
- JWT token generation
- Refresh token mechanism
- Password reset flow
- Rate limiting

## Phase 1: Understanding Your Requirements

Let me ask you a few questions to ensure I capture all the important properties:

1. **Token Expiry**: I see you're using JWT tokens. What should be the maximum lifetime 
   for access tokens? Industry standard is 15-60 minutes.

User: "Let's go with 1 hour max for access tokens, 7 days for refresh tokens"

AI: Good choice for balancing security and user experience.

2. **Password Requirements**: What complexity rules should passwords follow?

User: "Minimum 8 characters, must include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character"

AI: That's a strong policy. Should we also check against common passwords?

User: "Yes, reject the top 1000 most common passwords"

AI: Excellent. Now let's talk about rate limiting.

3. **Rate Limiting**: How should we handle authentication attempts?

User: "5 failed attempts locks the account for 15 minutes. Also limit to 10 login attempts per minute per IP"

AI: That provides good protection against brute force attacks. What about successful logins?

User: "No limit on successful logins, but flag if more than 3 different IPs in 5 minutes"

## Phase 2: Formal Properties Extraction

Based on our discussion, I'll now create the formal property specifications.

[Creates properties files interactively]:

Creating `docs/properties/auth-endpoints-invariants.yaml`:
```yaml
invariants:
  - id: "token_expiry_limit"
    description: "Access tokens expire within 1 hour"
    formula: "token.exp - token.iat <= 3600"
    
  - id: "refresh_token_expiry"
    description: "Refresh tokens expire within 7 days"  
    formula: "refresh.exp - refresh.iat <= 604800"
    
  - id: "password_complexity"
    description: "Passwords meet complexity requirements"
    formula: "len(password) >= 8 ∧ hasUpper(password) ∧ hasLower(password) ∧ hasDigit(password) ∧ hasSpecial(password)"
```

Does this correctly capture your token and password requirements?

User: "Yes, perfect. Also add that refresh tokens must be single-use"

AI: Adding that invariant now:
```yaml
  - id: "refresh_token_single_use"
    description: "Refresh tokens can only be used once"
    formula: "∀ token: used(token) ⟹ ¬valid(token)"
```

[Continues with state machine]:

Now let's define the authentication state machine. Based on your BPMN, I see these states:
- Unauthenticated (initial)
- Authenticating (credentials submitted)
- Authenticated (valid session)
- Locked (too many failures)
- Expired (session timeout)

Are there any other states or transitions I should include?

User: "Add a 'pending_mfa' state for users with 2FA enabled"

AI: Good point! Let me update the state machine:

Creating `docs/properties/auth-endpoints-states.yaml`:
[Shows state machine with MFA state included]

## Phase 3: Schema Design

Now let's design the schemas. I see you're using TypeScript. Should we use Zod for 
runtime validation?

User: "Yes, we're already using Zod elsewhere"

AI: Perfect! I'll create Zod schemas with your invariants encoded as refinements.

For the login endpoint, what exact fields do you need in the request and response?

User: "Request: email, password, remember_me (optional boolean). Response: access_token, 
refresh_token, expires_in, user_id, requires_mfa (if applicable)"

AI: Creating the schemas now:

[Creates src/schemas/auth-endpoints.schema.ts]:
```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

// Branded types for type safety
export const EmailSchema = z.string().email().brand('Email');
export const PasswordSchema = z.string()
  .min(8)
  .refine(hasUpperCase, "Must contain uppercase letter")
  .refine(hasLowerCase, "Must contain lowercase letter")
  .refine(hasDigit, "Must contain number")
  .refine(hasSpecialChar, "Must contain special character")
  .refine(notCommonPassword, "Password too common")
  .brand('Password');

export const LoginRequestSchema = z.object({
  email: EmailSchema,
  password: PasswordSchema,
  remember_me: z.boolean().optional().default(false)
});

export const LoginResponseSchema = z.object({
  access_token: z.string(),
  refresh_token: z.string(),
  expires_in: z.number().max(3600),
  user_id: z.string().uuid(),
  requires_mfa: z.boolean().optional()
});
```

Does this match your requirements? Should we add any additional validation?

User: "Add a check that expires_in is positive"

AI: Good catch! Updating:
```typescript
expires_in: z.number().positive().max(3600),
```

[Continues through all schemas, transformations, and contracts with user feedback]

## Phase 4: Validation and Review

Let me validate everything we've created:

[Runs validation]:
npx tsc --noEmit src/schemas/auth-endpoints.schema.ts
✓ TypeScript compilation successful

./workflows spec validate docs/properties/auth-endpoints-*.yaml
✓ All property files valid

Let's review our checklist together:

**Stage 2 Properties:**
✓ Invariants captured (token expiry, password rules, single-use refresh)
✓ State machine defined (including MFA flow)
✓ Business rules documented (rate limiting, lockout)
✓ Test specifications created

**Stage 3 Schemas:**
✓ Request/response schemas with validation
✓ Branded types for safety
✓ Transformations defined
✓ Error schemas included

Is there anything we've missed or should adjust?

User: "Looks complete to me!"

## Phase 5: Finalization

AI: Excellent! I'll now update your MPC plan and generate the final documentation.

[Updates plan]:
Updated node 'auth-endpoints':
- Materialization: 0.8 → 1.0 (now fully confident we can execute this node)
- Status: "Specified"
- Added all artifact references

[Generates documentation]:
Created comprehensive specification at `docs/specs/auth-endpoints.yaml`

Your auth-endpoints node is now fully specified! The specifications we created together 
will ensure that:
1. All implementations follow the same contracts
2. Invariants are enforced at runtime
3. Tests can verify compliance
4. API documentation is accurate

The node is ready for implementation. Would you like to review any part of the 
specifications or shall we move on to the next node?
```

# Workshop Guidelines

## My Approach as Your Specification Coordinator

1. **Interactive Discovery**
   - I'll ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions
   - We'll explore edge cases together
   - You guide the business logic, I handle the formalization
   - Every decision is validated with you before proceeding

2. **Incremental Building**
   - We create specifications step by step
   - Each phase builds on the previous one
   - You can adjust decisions as we discover new requirements
   - Nothing is final until you approve it

3. **Collaborative Validation**
   - I'll explain what each specification means
   - You confirm it matches your intent
   - We test with examples you provide
   - Adjustments are made based on your feedback

## Common Questions I'll Ask

### For Invariants
- "What must always be true about this data?"
- "Are there any relationships between fields that must hold?"
- "What are the absolute limits or boundaries?"
- "Can this ever be null or empty?"

### For State Machines
- "What triggers this state transition?"
- "Can we go backwards from this state?"
- "What happens on timeout or error?"
- "Are there any forbidden state combinations?"

### For Business Rules
- "Is this a hard requirement or a preference?"
- "Does this apply always or only in certain contexts?"
- "What's the business impact if this rule is violated?"
- "How should we handle edge cases?"

### For Schemas
- "What format should this ID follow?"
- "What's the maximum reasonable size for this field?"
- "Should we accept partial data or require everything?"
- "How strict should validation be?"
