# Temporal Workflow Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
Implementation of Temporal workflow orchestration framework for a Golang project, enabling long-running workflows with human-in-the-loop capabilities.

## Key Requirements
- **Duration**: Support workflows spanning days to weeks
- **Integration**: Native Golang implementation with CLI access
- **Interaction**: Human task management with escalation
- **Reliability**: Extreme durability and fault tolerance

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Set up Temporal server infrastructure
- Create base Golang project structure
- Implement core workflow interfaces

### Phase 2: Workflow Library (Week 3-4)
- Design reusable workflow patterns
- Build workflow generator system
- Integrate with CLI commands

### Phase 3: BPMN Adaptation (Week 5-6)
- Map BPMN elements to Temporal concepts
- Create migration utilities
- Adapt existing workflows

### Phase 4: Validation & Testing (Week 7-8)
- Implement comprehensive validation framework
- Create test suites for all workflows
- Performance and durability testing

## Technical Highlights

### Workflow Capabilities
- **Code-based definitions** in Golang
- **Dynamic routing** for complex logic
- **Signal handling** for external events
- **Query support** for workflow state
- **Child workflows** for composition

### Human Task Management
- Task assignment via signals
- Deadline tracking with escalation
- Priority-based queue management
- UI views for task monitoring

### UI Components
1. **Full View**: Dashboard of all workflows and statuses
2. **Graph View**: Visual network of single workflow
3. **Queue View**: Human tasks awaiting action

## Success Metrics
- All workflows validated before deployment
- Human tasks properly routed and escalated
- Long-running workflows maintain state
- CLI provides full workflow control
- Error handling and recovery automated

## Risk Mitigation
- **Learning Curve**: Comprehensive documentation and examples
- **Infrastructure**: Automated deployment scripts
- **Complexity**: Start with simple workflows, iterate

## Next Actions
1. Review existing BPMN workflow patterns
2. Set up Temporal development environment
3. Create first prototype workflow
4. Establish testing framework

## Resources
- ADR-0001: Temporal workflow decision
- BPMN workflow command templates
- Temporal documentation and best practices
