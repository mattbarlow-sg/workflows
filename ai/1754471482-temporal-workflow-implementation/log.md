# Work Session Log: Temporal Workflow Implementation

## Session ID: 1754471482-temporal-workflow-implementation
## Start Date: 2025-08-06

---

## Session Overview
Implementing Temporal workflow orchestration framework with Golang based on ADR-0001. Focus on creating a workflow library, generators, and adapting existing BPMN workflows with validation and testing.

## Key Decisions from ADR-0001
- **Framework**: Temporal chosen for extreme durability and fault tolerance
- **Language**: Golang integration required
- **Requirements**: Long-running workflows (days to weeks), human-in-the-loop tasks
- **UI Views**: Full workflow view, network graph, human task queue

## Progress Log

### 2025-08-06 - Session Initialization
- Created work session directory structure
- Set CURRENT_WORK_SESSION environment variable
- Updated .envrc configuration
- Created initial planning documents

## Next Steps
1. Review existing BPMN workflow command structure
2. Design Temporal-specific workflow abstractions
3. Create workflow generator templates
4. Set up validation framework

## Notes
- Workflows must be validated and tested BEFORE Temporal implementation
- Need to ensure compatibility between BPMN definitions and Temporal patterns
- Focus on code-based workflow definitions for natural Golang integration
