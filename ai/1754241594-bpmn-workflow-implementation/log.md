# BPMN 2.0 Workflow Implementation Log

## Session Information
- **Session ID**: 1754241594-bpmn-workflow-implementation
- **Start Time**: 2025-01-03
- **Objective**: Create implementation plan for BPMN 2.0 workflow system

## Activities Completed

### Research Phase
1. Analyzed existing ADR workflow implementation
2. Researched BPMN 2.0 specifications and JSON representations
3. Investigated validation approaches beyond schema validation

### Documentation Phase
1. Created comprehensive architecture document
2. Developed detailed implementation plan
3. Set up work session structure

## Key Decisions
- Focus on JSON representation instead of XML
- Follow existing ADR system patterns
- Implement multi-level validation (schema, semantic, graph)
- Create modular schema design
- Provide AI-assisted workflow creation

## Next Steps
- Begin implementation starting with Task 1.1 (Core schemas)
- Follow the phased approach outlined in plan.md

## Implementation Progress

4. **Task 3.1: Create BPMN CLI Commands** ✓ (Partial)
   - Created `cmd/workflows/bpmn.go` with subcommands:
     - `bpmn new` - Create new processes from templates
     - `bpmn validate` - Validate BPMN files with semantic checking
     - `bpmn analyze` - Placeholder for graph analysis
   - Implemented three templates: basic, parallel, decision
   - Integrated with existing workflow CLI structure

5. **Task 3.2: Update Main CLI Router** ✓
   - Updated `cmd/workflows/main.go` to include BPMN command
   - Added BPMN to help text and command routing

#### Human Validation Tests Performed

1. **Build and Compilation** ✓
   - Successfully built the workflows binary
   - Fixed import issues (removed unused imports)

2. **CLI Command Tests** ✓
   - `./workflows bpmn help` - Shows BPMN subcommands
   - `./workflows bpmn new test-process` - Creates basic process
   - `./workflows bpmn new -template=parallel parallel-test` - Creates parallel template
   - `./workflows bpmn new -template=decision decision-test` - Creates decision template

3. **Validation Tests** ✓
   - `./workflows bpmn validate test-process.bpmn.json` - Validates basic process
   - `./workflows bpmn validate -verbose` - Shows process summary
   - Tested with existing test files - identified structure differences

#### Key Findings
- The Go implementation successfully creates valid BPMN processes
- Semantic validation correctly identifies connectivity issues
