# Critical Issues Remediation - Summary

## Overview

This work session successfully addressed all critical security and stability issues identified in the codebase risk analysis, plus one medium-priority technical debt item.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Error Handling Infrastructure (Critical)
- Created `internal/errors/errors.go` with structured error types
- Replaced all 36 `os.Exit()` calls with proper error returns
- Commands are now testable and errors propagate correctly

### 2. Input Validation (Security Critical)
- Created `internal/validation/paths.go` with security-focused validation
- Added path traversal protection
- Validates file extensions and schema names
- Applied to all file input points across the application

### 3. Configurable Schema Paths (High)
- Created `internal/config/config.go` for configuration management
- Supports `WORKFLOWS_SCHEMA_DIR` environment variable
- Automatic schema directory discovery with multiple fallback locations
- Removed all hardcoded schema paths

### 4. Updated Deprecated APIs (Medium)
- Replaced all `ioutil` package usage with modern `os` package
- Updated `ReadFile` and `WriteFile` calls
- Removed deprecated imports

## Manual Testing Instructions

### Test Error Handling

1. Test missing command:
```bash
./workflows
# Should show usage and exit with code 1
```

2. Test invalid subcommand:
```bash
./workflows invalid-command
# Should show error message and usage
```

3. Test missing required arguments:
```bash
./workflows validate
# Should show proper error message
```

### Test Input Validation

1. Test path traversal protection:
```bash
./workflows validate adr ../../../etc/passwd
# Should reject with "path traversal detected" error

./workflows adr validate ../../../etc/passwd
# Should reject with "path traversal detected" error
```

2. Test invalid schema names:
```bash
./workflows validate "schema/../../etc" test.json
# Should reject with "invalid character in schema name" error
```

3. Test file extension validation:
```bash
./workflows validate adr test.txt
# Should reject with "file must be .json" error
```

### Test Schema Path Configuration

1. Test default schema location:
```bash
./workflows list
# Should list schemas from ./schemas directory
```

2. Test custom schema directory:
```bash
WORKFLOWS_SCHEMA_DIR=/tmp/custom-schemas ./workflows list
# Should attempt to use /tmp/custom-schemas
# Falls back to ./schemas if directory doesn't exist
```

3. Test ADR validation with configured paths:
```bash
./workflows adr validate test-data/simple-adr.json
# Should use configured schema path
```

### Test Updated File Operations

1. Create an ADR:
```bash
./workflows adr new \
  -title "Test ADR" \
  -problem "Testing the new error handling" \
  -background "We need to verify everything works" \
  -chosen "Manual Testing" \
  -rationale "Ensures all changes work correctly" \
  -positive "Confidence in changes" \
  -output test-adr.json
```

2. Render ADR to markdown:
```bash
./workflows adr render test-adr.json -output test-adr.md
```

3. Validate the ADR:
```bash
./workflows adr validate test-adr.json
```

### Test BPMN Commands

1. Create a BPMN process:
```bash
./workflows bpmn new "Test Process"
# Should create test-process.bpmn.json
```

2. Validate BPMN file:
```bash
./workflows bpmn validate test-process.bpmn.json
```

3. Analyze BPMN process:
```bash
./workflows bpmn analyze test-process.bpmn.json
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] All commands return proper exit codes (0 for success, non-zero for errors)
- [ ] Path traversal attempts are blocked
- [ ] Invalid file types are rejected
- [ ] Schema directory can be configured via environment variable
- [ ] File operations work without ioutil package
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] No panic or unhandled errors occur

## Next Phase Recommendations

While Phase 1 critical issues are complete, the following improvements from Phase 2-3 are recommended:

1. **Break down large functions** (e.g., 300+ line `adrNewCommand`)
2. **Add comprehensive test suite** with >80% coverage
3. **Implement timeout protection** for graph analysis
4. **Optimize performance** of BPMN analyzer algorithms
5. **Add resource limits** to prevent DoS attacks

The codebase is now in a much more secure and maintainable state, ready for further enhancements.
