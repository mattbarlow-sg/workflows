# Critical Issues Remediation Log

## Phase 1: Critical Security and Stability

### Task 1.1: Replace os.Exit() Pattern  COMPLETED

**Changes made:**
1. Created error handling infrastructure in `internal/errors/errors.go`
   - Defined CLIError type with error types and exit codes
   - Created helper functions for different error categories
   - Provides consistent error handling across the application

2. Refactored main.go
   - Added run() function that returns errors
   - Main function now handles errors and exit codes properly
   - All command functions now return errors instead of calling os.Exit()

3. Refactored all command files
   - Updated listCommand, validateCommand to return errors
   - Modified adrCommand and all ADR subcommands to return errors
   - Modified bpmnCommand and all BPMN subcommands to return errors
   - Replaced all 36 instances of os.Exit() with proper error returns

**Benefits:**
- Commands are now testable (can capture errors in tests)
- Proper error propagation throughout the application
- Consistent exit codes based on error types
- Better error messages with context

**Files modified:**
- Created: `internal/errors/errors.go`
- Modified: `cmd/workflows/main.go`
- Modified: `cmd/workflows/adr.go`
- Modified: `cmd/workflows/bpmn.go`

### Task 1.2: Add Input Validation ✓ COMPLETED

**Changes made:**
1. Created validation package in `internal/validation/paths.go`
   - ValidateFilePath: Prevents path traversal attacks
   - ValidateSchemaName: Prevents injection via schema names
   - ValidateFileExtension: Ensures proper file types
   - ValidateOutputPath: Validates paths for file writing

2. Applied validation to all command entry points
   - main.go: validateCommand validates schema name and file paths
   - adr.go: All ADR commands validate input/output paths and extensions
   - bpmn.go: All BPMN commands validate file paths and process names

3. Created comprehensive test suite
   - Tests for path traversal detection
   - Tests for schema name validation
   - Tests for file extension validation

**Security improvements:**
- Prevents directory traversal attacks (../../../etc/passwd)
- Validates file extensions to prevent unexpected file types
- Ensures schema names cannot contain path separators
- Blocks absolute paths outside working directory

**Files created/modified:**
- Created: `internal/validation/paths.go`
- Created: `internal/validation/paths_test.go`
- Modified: `cmd/workflows/main.go`
- Modified: `cmd/workflows/adr.go`
- Modified: `cmd/workflows/bpmn.go`

### Task 1.3: Fix Hardcoded Schema Paths ✓ COMPLETED

**Changes made:**
1. Created configuration package in `internal/config/config.go`
   - Schema directory resolution with multiple fallback locations
   - Environment variable support (WORKFLOWS_SCHEMA_DIR)
   - Automatic discovery of schema location

2. Updated all hardcoded schema paths
   - main.go: Uses config for schema directory in list and validate commands
   - adr.go: Uses config.GetSchemaPath() for ADR schema

3. Schema directory resolution order:
   - WORKFLOWS_SCHEMA_DIR environment variable (highest priority)
   - ./schemas (current directory)
   - Schemas next to executable
   - /etc/workflows/schemas (system location)
   - ~/.workflows/schemas (user home)

**Benefits:**
- Flexible deployment options
- Environment-specific configuration
- No more hardcoded paths
- Works in different installation scenarios

**Files created/modified:**
- Created: `internal/config/config.go`
- Modified: `cmd/workflows/main.go`
- Modified: `cmd/workflows/adr.go`

## Phase 2: Technical Debt Cleanup

### Task 2.1: Replace Deprecated ioutil Package ✓ COMPLETED

**Changes made:**
1. Replaced all ioutil.ReadFile calls with os.ReadFile
   - adr.go: 2 occurrences replaced
   - bpmn.go: 1 occurrence replaced

2. Replaced all ioutil.WriteFile calls with os.WriteFile
   - adr.go: 2 occurrences replaced
   - bpmn.go: 1 occurrence replaced

3. Removed ioutil imports from both files
   - Removed from adr.go
   - Removed from bpmn.go

**Benefits:**
- Using modern Go APIs (ioutil is deprecated since Go 1.16)
- Cleaner code with direct os package usage
- Future-proof codebase

**Files modified:**
- Modified: `cmd/workflows/adr.go`
- Modified: `cmd/workflows/bpmn.go`

## Summary of Completed Work

All critical and high-priority issues from Phase 1 have been successfully addressed:

1. **Error Handling** - Replaced all 36 os.Exit() calls with proper error propagation
2. **Security** - Added comprehensive input validation to prevent path traversal attacks
3. **Configuration** - Made schema paths configurable via environment variables
4. **Technical Debt** - Updated deprecated ioutil package to use modern os package

The codebase is now more testable, secure, and maintainable.
